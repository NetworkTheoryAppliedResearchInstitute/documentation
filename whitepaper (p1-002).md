1. Abstract


Information moves at network speeds while governments operate in analog cycles. This velocity gap enables technology institutions to accumulate power faster than democratic accountability can respond—what Acemoglu and Robinson (2019) term a "Red Queen failure." Platforms exploit this gap for extraction offering frivolity rather than enterprise (Keynes, 1936). Cryptocurrency leaders propose abandoning accountability for plutocracy (Srinivasan, 2022). The Mass Production Network (MPN) offers a third path: open-source, context-specific networks for productive coordination, governed through continuous asynchronous processes, designed for universal accessibility. MPN enable societal capacity to evolve at internet velocities, maintaining the balance between power and accountability that liberty requires.

2. The Information Velocity Crisis


Current internet architectures create a fundamental mismatch: platforms update algorithms 500-600 times per year while government regulations take 2-7 years to enact (OECD, 2022). High-frequency trading firms hold positions for seconds to minutes (Kearns, 2013); regulatory investigations take 3-5 years (CNBC, 2019). This asymmetry isn't inefficiency—it's civil coordination failure.
Examples across three decades:

* Telecommunications Act (1996): 3-year legislative process obsolete before enactment
* GDPR (2012-2018): 6 years to enact while Facebook updated data collection practices hundreds of times
* COVID-19 (2020): CARES Act passed in 16 days—"emergency speed"—yet 164,000+ cases emerged during legislative process
* Cambridge Analytica (2018-present): 5+ year investigation while Facebook rebranded, pivoted business models, deployed dozens of new products

Red Queen Failure: Acemoglu and Robinson (2019) show liberty exists when state capacity and societal capacity to check power evolve together. When power evolves faster than checking capacity, liberty erodes. Platforms evolve at internet speeds (algorithm updates each day, business models each month) while democratic institutions evolve at meeting schedules (legislative sessions each year, elections every 2-4 years). Result: movement toward concentrated power (outside of government) without effective checks.

3. Mass Production Network: The Solution


MPN enables continuous evolution of checking capacity to match continuous evolution of power through five interconnected principles:

1. Function-Specific Design


Networks optimized for particular productive functions—consensus, coordination, communication, education, management—rather than broad, general-purpose with collaborative action as minor modules. Communication patterns in MPN match workflow requirements; velocity calibrated to decision timescales.

2. Universal Accessibility


* Linguistic: Multilingual by default (native language +5)
* Infrastructure: Operational on 2G/3G networks; text-first; works on aging hardware
* Economic: No subscription fees; no attention extraction; no platform rent
* Temporal: Asynchronous-first; no penalties for delayed responses; accommodates intermittent connectivity

3. Continuous Asynchronous Coordination


Stakeholders deliberate at their own pace, from any location, without simultaneous participation. This enables:

* Protocol discussions matching platform innovation pace
* Accountability adjustments in real time
* Parallel experimentation across communities
* Knowledge accumulation each day rather than resetting

Key insight: This is not about faster decisions, but enabling continuous evolution of checking capacity to match continuous evolution of power. Society can run the Red Queen race without exhausting participants or sacrificing deliberation quality.

4. Distributed Infrastructure, Accountable Governance


* Open protocols (AGPL v3) preventing proprietary capture
* Node operation distributed across stakeholders
* Transparent protocol evolution
* Democratic decision-making through continuous asynchronous processes
* Accountability embedded in architecture, not external regulation that lags

5. Mutual Equity


Design ensures velocity benefits all users:

* Time zone neutrality: Users add data as they are available in shared digital space
* Bandwidth democracy: Text-based deliberation accessible on low connectivity
* Economic inclusion: Participation without travel costs or expensive technology
* Linguistic justice: Time for quality translation; multiple languages simultaneously
* Cultural adaptation: Persistent records allow careful interpretation


4. NTARI Research Agenda


Technical Research:

* Asynchronous coordination protocols: message persistence, community self governance & conflict resolution, scalability to global communities, network/community detection
* Multilingual protocol design: efficient linguistic diversity handling, cultural concept adaptation, translation quality assurance at scale
* Low-bandwidth optimization: limits of coordination protocol compression, progressive enhancement strategies, offline-first architecture
* Velocity-matched accountability: real-time reputation systems, transparent audit mechanisms, continuous governance protocols

Governance Research:

* Asynchronous democratic processes: decision quality in asynchronous deliberation, participation breadth/depth trade-offs, velocity-matched consensus mechanisms
* Cross-cultural coordination: cultural concept translation, governance patterns across contexts, maintaining diversity while enabling coordination
* Power dynamics and capture prevention: preventing elite capture at velocity, ensuring continued accessibility, accountability mechanisms that evolve with power

Socioeconomic Research:

* Velocity and equity: measuring access inequality impacts, digital divide evolution with asynchronous coordination, gender dynamics in velocity-matched participation
* Adoption and transition: barriers to platform exit, network effects in function-specific architecture, trust factors across contexts
* Value distribution: funding models without extraction, cross-economic-context incentive structures, preventing wealth reconcentration, enterprise vs. speculation in network design
* Citizen Research: citizen research models, coordination methods, broadcasting, knowledge development and preservation, asynchronous testing and distributed observation 


5. Conclusion


The platform-driven information velocity crisis represents Red Queen failure at international scale. Contemporary platforms will not self-regulate and traditional regulation cannot run fast enough to contain them. Cryptocurrency implemented governance abandon accountability entirely. 
The Mass Production Network demonstrates that democratic coordination at internet speeds is architecturally achievable through networks designed for productive functions, governed through continuous asynchronous processes, accessible to all regardless of language, bandwidth, device, or economic status and completely open for market evolution.
As Acemoglu and Robinson show through historical analysis, liberty requires continuous adaptation—running the Red Queen race between power and accountability. For now, we remain in the narrow corridor, but we only stay here if we build the cultural infrastructure enabling society to compete with institutional resources.
